Security Tables
---------------

These tables contains registration information about users and their
associated groups.  Some of these tables are used for security purposes,
particularly in Perception 5.7.

Questionmark OnDemand maintains most of these tables for backwards
compatibility even though they are no longer considered the
authoritative source of user information.
