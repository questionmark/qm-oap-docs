Next Generation Tables
----------------------

As part of developing the next generation Questionmark platform older
tables are being superseded by new tables most of which do not have any
prefix to their name.  These *next generation* tables are documented
here.

Although these tables represent the most up-to-date parts of the data
model the need to interact with the directly is limited as they are
generally available through :od:svc:`deliveryodata`.  You should always
access these tables through the API as that imposes additional business
rules and constraints that are not coded into the data model itself.
