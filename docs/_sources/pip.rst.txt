PIP
---

PIP stands for Perception Integration Protocol.  PIP defines:

1.  A protocol for passing query-string or form parameters to the
    delivery system primarily to launch tests directly from a user's
    browser

2.  A callback protocol defining a RESTful API that can be implemented
    by third-party systems enabling them to receive notifications of
    important delivery events.  This is primarily used for receiving
    notifications at the end of an assessment.

PIP is highly customisable and is configured through the use of one
or more 'pip' files uploaded to the repository.
